* FORALL Macro

?FORALL(InstanceOfType, TypeGenerator, PropertyExpression).

can be translated in:

proper:forall(TypeGenerator, fun(InstanceOfType) -> PropertyExpression end).

* Generators

Eunit syntax
```
biggest_test() ->
  ?assert(5 =:= biggest([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])),
  ?assert(8 =:= biggest([3, 8, 7, -1])),
  ?assert(-5 =:= biggest([-10, -5, -901])),
  ?assert(0 =:= biggest([0])).
```

vs. PropEr(get a far better coverage of edge cases,including those we wouldnâ€™t think of by ourselves)
```
prop_biggest() ->
  ?FORALL(List, list(integer()),
    begin
      biggest(List) =:= lists:last(lists:sort(List))
    end).
```

Of course we should not use lists:last and lists:sort anymore in implementation of the function biggest/1
